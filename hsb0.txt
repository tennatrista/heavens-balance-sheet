Everyone deals with the inevitability of death in their own way. Some concoct elaborate fictions to explain away its permanence. Others do their best to sweep its traces into the shadows. A few tortured souls welcome its cold embrace. As for me, I was ambivalent, neither fearing death nor welcoming it. Death was simply something that was going to happen sooner or later, and I didn't particularly care whether it was sooner or later.

I wasn't always like this. I was once a bright-eyed child like the rest of them, standing before a future of infinite possibilities. I walked up the staircase laid before me, progressing as everyone expected. I got decent grades, went to a respectable college, and graduated with a handful of minor honors. After that, I moved out west and landed a cushy desk job. At each step, I feared death just as much as everyone else. To die would be to lose out on all the steps that followed.

Things changed once I reached the last step of that staircase and had a look around. To be fair, my life was comfortable. Privileged, even. I had a well-paying job, no debt, and no personal drama. The only problem was that none of it meant anything to me. Day after day, I went to work, waited until it was socially acceptable to leave, and returned home to gorge myself on takeout and cheap entertainment. That was all I had the will to do, day after day.

The days blurred into each other, as did the months and the years. I guess it was natural. Once you're out of school, you stop being bound by the year-long school cycle. You start losing track of the passage of time. Even the changing of the seasons did nothing to help, as I spent all my days confined in a sterile air-conditioned environment. Every day was like the last, and entire years seemed to pass by without me noticing.

What difference did it make how much time you spent on Earth if you couldn't even feel the time passing? Why continue the tiresome, plodding routine with no light at the end of the tunnel? I just couldn't see any of it mattering. There was nothing to strive for, nothing to long for, and nothing to live for.

I came to think of death simply as the next step on the staircase. With that in mind, one night, drained by yet another long day at the office, I decided it wasn't worth the effort to look both ways before crossing the road.

They say your life flashes before your eyes when you die, but nothing of the sort happened to me. I just remember lying on the ground, bloody and mangled. It hurt a lot, I think, but more than anything, it felt like going to sleep. I was tired, not just from the day, but from everything. I craved a good, long sleep. The longer the better. The road, still a little warm from the day's sun, was surprisingly comfortable. A perfect place to rest. Watching the truck that hit me speed away, I lay there on my asphalt bed, drifting off to sleep, battered, bruised, and dying, feeling like everything was going to be all right when I woke up in the morning.

I wasn't going to wake up, of course, and even if I did, nothing was going to be okay. Even if everything went perfectly, I would wake up in horrible pain, recovering in some hospital room, waiting to be sent back to my monotonous life with nothing but a crippling medical bill to show for my troubles. The more likely case was that I was dying, and once you're dead, it's over. There was no Heaven, no Valhalla, no reincarnation. I never believed in any of those made-up distractions, nor did I want to. It wasn't so bad, I thought, to disappear from the world and enjoy a big, heaping dose of nothingness for all eternity.

Well, as it turns out, that wasn't what happened. Too bad for me, I guess.
